\f0\fs24 \cf0 First and foremost at the beginning of any project there is both a combination of fear and miscalculation. I think for any computer programmer about the embark on an engineering journey of which they are unfamiliar, there is a fear that the task at hand and the many twist and turns and journey is bound to produce will be insurmountable for our budding skills. Fear is often apprehension of the unknown, which leads to the later point about the beginning of every project\'97miscalculation. It has rarely, if ever, been the case that a project has taken less time than I thought it would take to complete, even with conservative approximations. It seems, that not matter what I do, projects will take at least three times as long as I have budgeted for. \

Every journey begins with a single step. I wasn\'92t entirely sure how to begin projectNeon. I had been mulling over in my mind some elements that I would need and would have to account for, but that\'92s a far leap from putting something down on paper (or in this case in my Processing IDE). I thought a good place to start is with what I know. Just create a canvas, and make it black. Done. Off to a great start. Now, lets get some objects on this blank screen, might as well put up one of the awesome graphics my project partner Dante drew up. And, that\'92s when I encountered the first problem. None of the graphics were saved as SVGs. Trying to export and upload a simple SVG was throwing errors.}
